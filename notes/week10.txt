- added del child subroutine to cancel button on edit tile form
- form construction and navigation now robust and workable, need to add meat into methods
- - Had to relearn methods for json library in python, haven't used since last year. json.dumps() and json.loads() and file access pointers
- - Learnt how to manipulate tables in pyqt5 for world-map-loading
- - made table font bold for easier reading
- Encountered numerous issues in implementing such as info labels not updating due to forgetting you had to use setText() method, many other trivial issues
- Issue with opening edit tile form and passing tile object to class constructor, interpreter says passing too many arguments
- - Issue resolved after much time by realizing I was editing the item edit form, not the tile edit form.
- Completed feature of loading data into program and widgets. Next is saving form data and dumping into a json file
