- Resolved issue of being unable to create new terminal for game on windows by using "start /wait" command (from "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5137497/find-current-directory-and-files-directory")
- - Tested this on school computer

- Encountered issue of program only being able to be ran in tbrpgepp directory due to usage of relative paths in program

- Found an issue where the bubbleSort returns None if given an empty dict form
- - Resolved by adding an if statement in bubblesort that automatically returns and empty list if given one
- - - Also could've been solved by adding a "return iterable" at the very end of the method after the main loop but that would have been less clear of a solution
