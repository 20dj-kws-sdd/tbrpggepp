\begin{itemize}
	\item Name: this is the name of the enemy within the game, and it will be seen by the player.
	\item Dmg Type: the damage type of the enemy; in more complicated narratives this feature can be used to enrich gameplay. A weapon of a specific damage type interacting with an enemy of the same damage type deals potentially massive damamge.
	\item Max HP: The maximum number of health points carried by the enemy. Note that the player character starts with maximum health at 10 HP.
	\item Attack Dmg: The maximum amount of HP the enemy can detract from the player during one turn of a battle.
	\item Cancel: closes the form without saving changes.
	\item Save Item: closes the form while saving the enemy to the parent Edit Tile form.
\end{itemize}
